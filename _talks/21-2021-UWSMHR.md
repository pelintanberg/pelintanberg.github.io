Since Winter 2020, the Faculty of Health has offered an undergraduate Mental Health Literacy course (AHS 105) for all students on campus. We conducted a study on a novel final assessment in which student were asked to reflect on their key learnings as well as their achievement of the course-level learning outcomes.
