Does completion of a course on MHL have an effect on students&apos; MHL-related attitudes, help-seeking intent, or perceived barriers to care? In a pre-post design, this study suggests that a course dedicated to MHL can have a significant, positive impact of several aspects of MHL in students.  Further, our findings support AHS&apos;s commitment to offering AHS 105 to all students on campus in future terms.
