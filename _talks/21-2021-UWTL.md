In 2020, the Faculty of Health launched the University of Waterloo&apos;s first undergraduate course on mental health literacy so that students could earn course credit for learning about mental health self-care and support for others. We conducted three studies that build on early research conducted by two of the presenters, examining students&apos; outcomes following taking this course.
