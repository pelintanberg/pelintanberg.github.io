We investigated the properties of recurrent IAMs in general populations, and assessed their relation to mental health. We found that recurrent IAMs were experienced by most of our sample (52%), and that these memories were mostly negative in valence. Those reporting a negative IAM as their most frequently recurring also reported significantly more mental health concerns (e.g., posttraumatic stress, social anxiety, depression).
