We describe the design and evaluation of the University of Waterloo�s first Mental Health Literacy course for undergraduate credit. We conducted a study measuring indicators of students� mental health literacy (e.g., attitudes toward help-seeking) at the start and end of the course (N = 37). Some significant improvements were found, along with strongly positive student feedback.
