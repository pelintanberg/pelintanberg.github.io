Do individuals with high social anxiety show altered memory function for social materials? We asked if semantic meaning (i.e., social threat) drives subsequent memory. In two experiments, we find biases in long-term memory as well as working memory that are social threat-specific, which could not be explained by valence, arousal, or semantic similarity.
