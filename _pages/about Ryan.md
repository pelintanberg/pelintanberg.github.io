üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Psychology at the Toronto Metropolitan University. I am part of the [Memory and Decision Processing Lab](https://psychlabs.torontomu.ca/madlab/).

üî¨ My research focuses on bridging cognitive science and human-computer interaction. 

üß† As a Cognitive Scientist, I am interested in how humans adaptively monitor, control, and organize their own thought processes to combat cognitive overload. 

‚öôÔ∏è My recent work focuses on leveraging insights from cognitive psychology of memory and metacognition to study human-AI interactions and designing trustworthy and reliable technological systems. 

üéì I completed my PhD in Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto. I was part of the [Memory, Attention, and Cognition Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/memory-attention-cognition-lab) and the [Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/cognitive-neuroscience-lab/), co-supervised by Dr. Colin MacLeod and Dr. Myra Fernandes. I also received a Graduate Diploma in Computational Data Analytics for the Social Sciences and Humanities. 

üîé I am looking for research job and collaboration opportunities that focus on integrating insights from cognitive sciences to shaping the future of technology. 

## Bio 

I received my PhD in Cognitive Science from the University of Waterloo, MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience from Queen's University, and BSc in Biology & Psychology from Wilfrid Laurier University. I have received several awards for my academic, teaching, and research achievements, most notably the Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship (top-ranked applicant) and the Michael Smith Foreign Fellowship to collaborate with Dr. Klaus Oberauer at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. Both awards were funded by the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). I have also received three teaching awards from Queen's University, including the SGPS Teaching Fellow Excellence Award. Finally, I was awarded the Donald O. Hebb Graduate Student Award for Best Oral Presentation (Hon. Mention) in July 2023 for my presentation on the role of context on human memory organization. 

I am passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion in research and have been an active member of the academic community. I have served as a Trainee Board Member of [Women in Cognitive Science Canada+](https://wicsc.ca/), the Associate Member-at-Large for the [Canadian Society for Brain, Behaviour, and Cognitive Science](https://www.csbbcs.org/home), the Graduate Student Representation for the [Healthy Labs group](https://uwaterloo.ca/healthy-labs-psychology/) at the University of Waterloo to advocate for inclusion in lab environment, and member of the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion group for the [Canadian Society for Brain, Behaviour, and Cognitive Science](https://www.csbbcs.org/home). 

üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥ Outside of research, I spend all my time cooking and developing new recipes. I am currently attending 
üíê‚úíÔ∏è On the weekends, I dabble in wedding coordination, calligraphy, and floral design freelancing with the amazing [Dereves Studio](https://www.derevesstudio.com/). 

I am a self-proclaimed Potterhead ‚ö°üßô and a sunset chaser üåÜ. 



> ### What predicts recurrent memories? üîÆ
Are there properties of specific memories (e.g., their emotionality) or people (e.g., their age) that predict the quantity and/or quality of recurrent memories?

> ### Are recurrent memories related to mental health? ü§ï
Do recurrent memories and/or their properties predict symptoms of mental health disorders? Can individual differences (e.g., trait emotion regulation) alter these relationships?

> ### What are recurrent memories about? üìù
What types of events do people have recurrent memories about? Can memory content (i.e., what people describe remembering) distinguish between those that are harmless or harmful?

> ### How can computational methods enhance memory research? ‚öôÔ∏è
Can techniques like machine learning and natural language processing allow us to ask (and answer) new questions about autobiographical (real-life) memories?

Outside of research, I'm a fan of <a href="{{ base_path }}/hobbies/">hipster music</a>, hipster tabletop role-playing games, and insisting that I'm not actually a hipster.
