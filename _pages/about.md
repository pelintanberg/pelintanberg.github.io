üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Psychology at the Toronto Metropolitan University. I am part of the [Memory and Decision Processing Lab](https://psychlabs.torontomu.ca/madlab/).

Broadly speaking, I study how *real-life memories shape (and are shaped by) individuals' cognitive and neural profiles.* My research interests lie at the interface of memory, emotion, and psychopathology.

My recent work has focused on *recurrent memories*, or memories of the personal past that spring to mind unintentionally and repetitively (sometimes called intrusive memories). For example, I have tackled questions like:

> ### What predicts recurrent memories? üîÆ
Are there properties of specific memories (e.g., their emotionality) or people (e.g., their age) that predict the quantity and/or quality of recurrent memories?

> ### Are recurrent memories related to mental health? ü§ï
Do recurrent memories and/or their properties predict symptoms of mental health disorders? Can individual differences (e.g., trait emotion regulation) alter these relationships?

> ### What are recurrent memories about? üìù
What types of events do people have recurrent memories about? Can memory content (i.e., what people describe remembering) distinguish between those that are harmless or harmful?

> ### How can computational methods enhance memory research? ‚öôÔ∏è
Can techniques like machine learning and natural language processing allow us to ask (and answer) new questions about autobiographical (real-life) memories?

Outside of research, I'm a fan of <a href="{{ base_path }}/hobbies/">hipster music</a>, hipster tabletop role-playing games, and insisting that I'm not actually a hipster.
