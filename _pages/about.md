üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Psychology at the Toronto Metropolitan University. I am part of the [Memory and Decision Processing Lab](https://psychlabs.torontomu.ca/madlab/).

üî¨ My research focuses on bridging cognitive science and human-computer interaction. 

üß† As a Cognitive Scientist, I am interested in how humans adaptively monitor, control, and organize their own thought processes to combat cognitive overload. 

‚öôÔ∏è My recent work focuses on leveraging insights from cognitive psychology of memory and metacognition to study human-AI interactions and designing trustworthy and reliable technological systems. 

üéì I completed my PhD in Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto. I was part of the [Memory, Attention, and Cognition Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/memory-attention-cognition-lab) and the [Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/cognitive-neuroscience-lab/), co-supervised by Dr. Colin MacLeod and Dr. Myra Fernandes. I also received a Graduate Diploma in Computational Data Analytics for the Social Sciences and Humanities. 

üîé I am looking for research job and collaboration opportunities that focus on integrating insights from cognitive sciences to shaping the future of technology. 

## Bio 




> ### What predicts recurrent memories? üîÆ
Are there properties of specific memories (e.g., their emotionality) or people (e.g., their age) that predict the quantity and/or quality of recurrent memories?

> ### Are recurrent memories related to mental health? ü§ï
Do recurrent memories and/or their properties predict symptoms of mental health disorders? Can individual differences (e.g., trait emotion regulation) alter these relationships?

> ### What are recurrent memories about? üìù
What types of events do people have recurrent memories about? Can memory content (i.e., what people describe remembering) distinguish between those that are harmless or harmful?

> ### How can computational methods enhance memory research? ‚öôÔ∏è
Can techniques like machine learning and natural language processing allow us to ask (and answer) new questions about autobiographical (real-life) memories?

Outside of research, I'm a fan of <a href="{{ base_path }}/hobbies/">hipster music</a>, hipster tabletop role-playing games, and insisting that I'm not actually a hipster.
