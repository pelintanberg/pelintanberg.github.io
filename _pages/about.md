Hi there! I'm Ryan. I'm a doctoral researcher at the University of Waterloo. I study ***recurrent memories***, or memories of the personal past that spring to mind unintentionally and repetitively. For example, I tackle questions like:

### <span style="color: #1d6bd1;"> What predicts recurrent memories? </span> üîÆ
Are there properties of specific memories (e.g., their emotionality) or the people that experience them (e.g., their age) that predict the occurrence of recurrent memories?
### <span style="color: #1d6bd1;"> Are recurrent memories related to mental health? </span> ü§ï
Do recurrent memories or their properties predict symptoms of mental health disorders? Can individual differences (e.g., trait emotion regulation) alter these relationships?
### <span style="color: #1d6bd1;"> What are recurrent memories about? </span> üìù
What types of events do people have recurrent memories about? Can the contents of recurrent memories distinguish between those that are harmless or harmful?
