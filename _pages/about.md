Hi there! I'm Ryan. 

I'm a doctoral researcher at the University of Waterloo. I study ***recurrent memories***, or memories of the personal past that spring to mind unintentionally and repetitively. For example, I tackle questions like:

> ### What predicts recurrent memories? üîÆ
Are there properties of specific memories (e.g., their emotionality) or people (e.g., their age) that predict how recurrent memories are experienced?

> ### Are recurrent memories related to mental health? ü§ï
Do recurrent memories or their properties predict symptoms of mental health disorders? Can individual differences (e.g., trait emotion regulation) alter these relationships?

> ### What are recurrent memories about? üìù
What types of events do people have recurrent memories about? Can the contents of recurrent memories distinguish between those that are harmless or harmful?

> ### How can computational methods enhance memory research? ‚öôÔ∏è
Can techniques like machine learning and natural language processing allow us to answer new questions about autobiographical memories?

Outside of research, I'm a fan of hipster music, hipster tabletop role-playing games, and insisting that I'm not actually a hipster.
