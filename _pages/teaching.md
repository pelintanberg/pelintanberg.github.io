# Student testimonials

> *I just wanted to say thanks for all of the constructive criticism on my paper in the class, there was a lot of valuable information in your feedback and I'll do my best to use it in future papers. Having had TAs in the past who were very unresponsive and unclear about what they wanted for some assignments, I wanted to thank you for being helpful and just overall being a great TA, even through the online course.*

> *This was extremely helpful, thank you for your detailed response.*
> *Your dedication and goals as a TA are inspiring, just know that your students really appreciate your efforts! I will come up with some potential proposal ideas this week.*

> *Ryan was very detailed in explaining which areas needed improvement and suggested great ways in which I could correct my resume.*

> *The TA highlighted the good aspects on my resume, and also highlighted sections for improvement. This is helpful as I now know what to continue doing for my resume's and what to change.*
> *The TA also went into detail and checked my resume thoroughly, identifying specific skill types, grammar errors and experience to correct and improve on.*
