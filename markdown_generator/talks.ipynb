Whereas voluntary AMs are retrieved using deliberate search processes, involuntary autobiographical memories (IAMs) pop into awareness without any attempt at retrieval. Recent work indicates that these IAMs are often recurrent: episodes of the same event are reexperienced repetitively. However, the basic nature of recurrent memories as a form of AM is disputed. While some argue that recurrent IAMs and voluntary AMs exist along a spectrum in terms of memory properties (e.g., vividness, emotionality), others argue that they are categorically different phenomena with categorically different impacts on mental health (e.g., depression, PTSD). Here, we examined current models of IAMs by administering surveys to undergraduates (N = 4,801), which probed for recurrent IAMs, voluntary AMs, and symptoms of mental health disorders. Results indicated that recurrent IAMs were largely distinguished by higher emotionality/importance and lower vividness than voluntary AMs, though both types of memory overlapped considerably with regard to memory properties.

      "Assessing impacts of Waterloo's undergraduate mental health literacy course\tTalk (co-author)\t2021-UWTL\tUniversity of Waterloo\tx2021-4-27\t\"Waterloo, ON\"\t\t\"In 2020, the Faculty of Health launched the University of Waterloo's first undergraduate course on mental health literacy so that students could earn course credit for learning about mental health self-care and support for others. We conducted three studies that build on early research conducted by two of the presenters, examining students' outcomes following taking this course.\"\t\"Concerns about post-secondary students' mental health and well-being, as well as their generally low levels of mental health literacy, were well-documented before the COVID-19 pandemic (Clough et al., 2019; Gorczynski et al., 2020; Hern�ndez-Torrano et al., 2020). To address these concerns, in the Winter term of 2020, the [Faculty] launched [Institution]'s first undergraduate [course] so that students could earn a credit for learning about mental health self-care and support for others. With support from an [Institution] Learning Innovation and Teaching Enhancement (LITE) SEED grant, we conducted three studies that build on early research conducted by two of the presenters (reference blinded for review). Study 1: In each term of 2021, we conducted a pre-post study to examine indicators of students' mental health literacy (e.g., attitudes toward help-seeking, stigma and self-stigma). A total of 161 students participated across the pre-post studies, and within-subjects analysis was possible with 51 participants. Study 2: One month after the end of the Fall 2021 term, we conducted a follow-up study to assess whether students were continuing to use wellness behaviours learned and practiced during the course. To date, 18 students have participated in the follow-up study. Study 3: In the Winter and Spring terms of 2021, we conducted a content analysis of students' final assignments to examine qualitative outcomes of having taken the course. In these assignments, students were asked to reflect on their key take-aways from the course as well as their achievement of the course-level learning outcomes. A total of 32 students participated in the third study. In this presentation, we will describe our findings from all three studies. All procedures were approved by the [Institution]'s Office of Research Ethics. \"\n",

While some argue that these memories contribute to clinical disorders, recurrent IAMs are also commonly experienced in everyday life. Few studies have considered characterizing the content of recurrent IAMs. In our study, we asked if content could distinguish between maladaptive recurrent IAMs that predict mental health status, and benign ones. Over two years, 9157 undergraduates completed surveys about recurrent IAMs, 3624 of whom wrote text descriptions of their memory. We identified coherent topics (e.g., friendships, car accidents) in these descriptions using structural topic models, a method of unsupervised machine learning. Further, mental health indices (e.g., depression, anxiety) uniquely predicted some topics in recurrent IAMs (e.g., trauma, stressful events), but not others (e.g., negative emotion, recreation). Our work shows that these topics - and their links to mental health - are identifiable, distinguishable, and quantifiable.\"\n",

In two experiments, we investigated whether anxiety-provoking context scenes lessened the context reinstatement (CR) benefit. During encoding, participants viewed target faces paired with scenes pre-rated as either highly anxiety-provoking or not, half of which contained other faces embedded within the scene. At retrieval, target faces were re-presented with either the same or a new context scene. In Experiment 1, the expected CR benefit occurred when contexts consisted of low-anxiety scenes, or high- anxiety scenes without embedded faces. In contrast, the CR benefit was reduced when contexts were high-anxiety scenes containing embedded faces. In Experiment 2, to determine whether the presence of embedded faces, or anxiety level of scenes drove the reduced CR effect, we included contexts consisting of low-anxiety scenes with embedded faces. Once again, the CR effect was shown to be reduced, only when the context scene was highly anxiety-provoking with embedded faces; that is, reinstating the same, versus new, anxiety-provoking context failed to benefit target memory. Results suggest that the benefit of reinstating a context, on target memory, depends critically on the characteristics of the reinstated context.\"\n",
      "From tea cakes to trauma: Bridging gaps between involuntary memory and mental health\tTalk\t2019a-CSBBCS\tCSBBCS\tx2019-6-8\t\"Waterloo, ON\"\t\t\"We investigated the properties of recurrent IAMs in general populations, and assessed their relation to mental health. We found that recurrent IAMs were experienced by most of our sample (52%), and that these memories were mostly negative in valence. Those reporting a negative IAM as their most frequently recurring also reported significantly more mental health concerns (e.g., posttraumatic stress, social anxiety, depression). \"\t\"Memories of one's personal past that come to mind unintentionally and effortlessly are termed involuntary autobiographical memories (IAMs), and are reported to occur frequently in daily life within the general population (Berntsen, 1996; Rasmussen & Berntsen, 2011). In the current study, we investigate the properties of recurrent IAMs experienced in the general population, and assess their relation to mental health. Over two months, 2184 undergraduates responded to surveys querying the contents of their recurrent IAMs, as well as numerous qualitative aspects including their frequency and valence. Our findings show that recurrent IAMs are experienced by the majority of our sample (52%), and that these memories are mostly reported as being negative in valence. Additionally, those who report a negative IAM as their most frequently recurring one also report significantly more mental health concerns, including post-traumatic stress, social anxiety, and depression. We also found that the frequency at which an IAM recurs is predicted by the memory's level of detail, emotional intensity, and its centrality to one's life story. Finally, recurrent IAMs are described using significantly more words when they are emotionally positive, relative to negative or neutral. Recurrent IAMs may serve as a window into one's mental health.\"\n",

Here we used word span tasks, adapted from the digit span task, to assess working memory capacity for material of varying threat-relatedness, in individuals with high or low social anxiety. Our findings suggest that individuals high in social anxiety may fail to upregulate working memory capacity for social information due to the activation of socially threatening concepts.\"\t\"Objective: Differences in working memory capacity have been suggested in individuals with high levels of social anxiety. Specifically, they may preferentially maintain socially threatening material in working memory. Here we used a series of word span tasks, adapted from the digit span task, to assess working memory capacity for material of varying threat-relatedness, in individuals either high or low in social anxiety.\n",
      "Participants and Methods: In Experiment 1, 80 undergraduates were recruited (40 low social anxiety, 40 high social anxiety). Participants performed span tasks with words that were either neutral (e.g., \"\"errand\"\"), generally threatening (e.g., \"\"abuse\"\"), or socially threatening (e.g., \"\"party\"\"). In Experiment 2, another 80 undergraduates were recruited (40 low social anxiety, 40 high social anxiety). Participants performed the same span tasks with the addition of a fourth word list that was both neutral and matched to the socially threatening word list in terms of semantic similarity.\n",
      "Results: Experiment 1 revealed reduced working memory capacity for socially threatening words in those with high compared to low social anxiety. Importantly, this relative reduction in working memory capacity was driven by the low social anxiety group showing expanded capacity for socially threatening words relative to neutral or generally threatening words. Furthermore, reductions in working memory capacity for social threat were uniquely predicted by social anxiety, and not by other theoretically similar constructs such as state general anxiety, trait general anxiety, or depression. Experiment 2 showed that the semantic similarity of the words was not responsible for the differences in working memory capacity between list type or social anxiety group.\n",
