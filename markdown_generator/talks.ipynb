      "Assessing Waterloo�s first undergraduate course on mental health literacy: Did students� attitudes change over time?\tTalk\t2020-UWSMHR\tUniversity of Waterloo\t2020-11-5\t\"Waterloo, ON\"\thttps://web.archive.org/web/20210411054156/https://uwaterloo.ca/mental-health-wellness/cosmh-conference\t\"Does completion of a course on MHL have an effect on students� MHL-related attitudes, help-seeking intent, or perceived barriers to care? In a pre-post design, this study suggests that a course dedicated to MHL can have a significant, positive impact of several aspects of MHL in students.  Further, our findings support AHS�s commitment to offering AHS 105 to all students on campus in future terms.\"\t\"Purpose: In Winter 2020, the University of Waterloo launched its first undergraduate course on Mental Health Literacy (MHL). AHS 105: Mental Health Literacy was offered through the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences and was available to undergraduate students in all six Faculties. With ethics approval, we conducted a pre-post study to address the question �Does completion of a course on MHL have an effect on students� MHL-related attitudes, help-seeking intent, or perceived barriers to care?� \n",
      "Methods: At the beginning of the course, all students in AHS 105 (N = 106) were invited to participate in the study which involved completing demographic questions and seven online standardized scales. After the course ended, participants were asked to complete the same seven measures as well as three questions assessing general attitudes toward the course.\n",
      "Results:  Of the 40 students who participated in the study, most were women (87%), third-year or above (71%), from the Faculties of AHS (56%) or Arts (31%), and had a mean age of 20.9). Ten participants completed measures at both T1 and T2.  Despite low power, within-subject analysis showed that students made significant (p<.05) gains from T1 to T2, with a large effect size (d = .85) in terms of attitudes toward seeking mental health services. Feedback on the course was largely very positive, both in students� ratings and in their text comments.\n",

      "Altered working memory capacity for social threat words in high versus low social anxiety\tTalk\t2019-INS\tINS\t2019-2-23\t\"New York, NY\"\t\t\"Differences in working memory capacity may lead to preferential maintenance of socially threatening material in individuals with high social anxiety. Here we used word span tasks, adapted from the digit span task, to assess working memory capacity for material of varying threat-relatedness, in individuals with high or low social anxiety. Our findings suggest that individuals high in social anxiety may fail to upregulate working memory capacity for social information due to the activation of socially threatening concepts.\"\t\"Objective: Differences in working memory capacity have been suggested in individuals with high levels of social anxiety. Specifically, they may preferentially maintain socially threatening material in working memory. Here we used a series of word span tasks, adapted from the digit span task, to assess working memory capacity for material of varying threat-relatedness, in individuals either high or low in social anxiety.\n",
      "Participants and Methods: In Experiment 1, 80 undergraduates were recruited (40 low social anxiety, 40 high social anxiety). Participants performed span tasks with words that were either neutral (e.g., \"\"errand\"\"), generally threatening (e.g., \"\"abuse\"\"), or socially threatening (e.g., \"\"party\"\"). In Experiment 2, another 80 undergraduates were recruited (40 low social anxiety, 40 high social anxiety). Participants performed the same span tasks with the addition of a fourth word list that was both neutral and matched to the socially threatening word list in terms of semantic similarity.\n",
      "Results: Experiment 1 revealed reduced working memory capacity for socially threatening words in those with high compared to low social anxiety. Importantly, this relative reduction in working memory capacity was driven by the low social anxiety group showing expanded capacity for socially threatening words relative to neutral or generally threatening words. Furthermore, reductions in working memory capacity for social threat were uniquely predicted by social anxiety, and not by other theoretically similar constructs such as state general anxiety, trait general anxiety, or depression. Experiment 2 showed that the semantic similarity of the words was not responsible for the differences in working memory capacity between list type or social anxiety group.\n",

In a simultaneous target-distractor paradigm, we investigated if memory for targets and distractors was affected by threat-relatedness. We found that emory bias is specific to threat-related distractors in high social anxiety. When social anxiety is primed, attention and memory may be specifically heightened for irrelevant, socially threatening information.\"\t"
