What are recurrent memories about? Understanding their contents and links to mental health using computational text analysis	Talk	2021-CSBBCS	CSBBCS	6/17/21	"Montréal, QC"		"Researchers debate whether recurrent involuntary autobiographical memories (IAMs; personal memories retrieved unintentionally and repetitively) are pathological or ordinary. We asked if content could distinguish between maladaptive and benign recurrent IAMs. Using structural topic models, a method of unsupervised machine learning, we show that topics in recurrent IAMs – and their links to mental health – are identifiable, distinguishable, and quantifiable."	"Researchers debate whether recurrent involuntary autobiographical memories (IAMs; personal memories retrieved unintentionally and repetitively) are pathological or ordinary. While some argue that these memories contribute to clinical disorders, recurrent IAMs are also commonly experienced in everyday life. Few studies have considered characterizing the content of recurrent IAMs. In our study, we asked if content could distinguish between maladaptive recurrent IAMs that predict mental health status, and benign ones. Over two years, 9157 undergraduates completed surveys about recurrent IAMs, 3624 of whom wrote text descriptions of their memory. We identified coherent topics (e.g., friendships, car accidents) in these descriptions using structural topic models, a method of unsupervised machine learning. Further, mental health indices (e.g., depression, anxiety) uniquely predicted some topics in recurrent IAMs (e.g., trauma, stressful events), but not others (e.g., negative emotion, recreation). Our work shows that these topics – and their links to mental health – are identifiable, distinguishable, and quantifiable."
Assessing Waterloo’s first undergraduate course on mental health literacy: Did students’ attitudes change over time?	Talk	2020-UWSMHR	University of Waterloo	11/5/20	"Waterloo, ON"	https://web.archive.org/web/20210411054156/https://uwaterloo.ca/mental-health-wellness/cosmh-conference	"Does completion of a course on MHL have an effect on students’ MHL-related attitudes, help-seeking intent, or perceived barriers to care? In a pre-post design, this study suggests that a course dedicated to MHL can have a significant, positive impact of several aspects of MHL in students.  Further, our findings support AHS’s commitment to offering AHS 105 to all students on campus in future terms."	"Purpose: In Winter 2020, the University of Waterloo launched its first undergraduate course on Mental Health Literacy (MHL). AHS 105: Mental Health Literacy was offered through the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences and was available to undergraduate students in all six Faculties. With ethics approval, we conducted a pre-post study to address the question “Does completion of a course on MHL have an effect on students’ MHL-related attitudes, help-seeking intent, or perceived barriers to care?” 
Methods: At the beginning of the course, all students in AHS 105 (N = 106) were invited to participate in the study which involved completing demographic questions and seven online standardized scales. After the course ended, participants were asked to complete the same seven measures as well as three questions assessing general attitudes toward the course.
Results:  Of the 40 students who participated in the study, most were women (87%), third-year or above (71%), from the Faculties of AHS (56%) or Arts (31%), and had a mean age of 20.9). Ten participants completed measures at both T1 and T2.  Despite low power, within-subject analysis showed that students made significant (p<.05) gains from T1 to T2, with a large effect size (d = .85) in terms of attitudes toward seeking mental health services. Feedback on the course was largely very positive, both in students’ ratings and in their text comments.
Implications: This study suggests that a course dedicated to MHL can have a significant, positive impact of several aspects of MHL in students.  Further, our findings support AHS’s commitment to offering AHS 105 to all students on campus in future terms."
University of Waterloo’s undergraduate course on mental health literacy	Talk	2020-CICMH	Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental Health	11/3/20	"Toronto, ON"		"We describe the design and evaluation of the University of Waterloo’s first Mental Health Literacy course for undergraduate credit. We conducted a study measuring indicators of students’ mental health literacy (e.g., attitudes toward help-seeking) at the start and end of the course (N = 37). Some significant improvements were found, along with strongly positive student feedback."	"In this evidence-informed session, we describe the design and evaluation of the University of Waterloo’s first Mental Health Literacy course for undergraduate credit.  Offered through the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences, “AHS 105 Mental Health Literacy” was available to undergraduate students in all six Faculties in Winter 2020.  Ninety-six students completed the course.  Students applied course concepts to their own mental wellness through the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Personal Mental Wellness Plan.  Working in small groups, students designed and implemented a small project aimed at addressing one aspect of mental health in their campus community.  With ethics approval, we conducted a study measuring indicators of students’ mental health literacy (e.g., attitudes toward help-seeking) at the start and end of the course (N = 37).  We will report our findings along with student feedback."
Anxiety-provoking context scenes can reduce the context reinstatement effect	Talk*	2019b-CSBBCS	CSBBCS	6/9/19	"Waterloo, ON"		"Reinstating the same context from encoding during retrieval has been shown to benefit memory. In two experiments, we investigated whether anxiety-provoking context scenes lessened the context reinstatement (CR) benefit. We found that reinstating anxiety-provoking contexts failed to benefit target memory. Results suggest that the benefit of reinstating a context, on target memory, depends critically on the characteristics of the reinstated context."	"Reinstating the same context during retrieval, as at encoding, has been shown to benefit memory for targets associated with that context. In two experiments, we investigated whether anxiety-provoking context scenes lessened the context reinstatement (CR) benefit. During encoding, participants viewed target faces paired with scenes pre-rated as either highly anxiety-provoking or not, half of which contained other faces embedded within the scene. At retrieval, target faces were re-presented with either the same or a new context scene. In Experiment 1, the expected CR benefit occurred when contexts consisted of low-anxiety scenes, or high- anxiety scenes without embedded faces. In contrast, the CR benefit was reduced when contexts were high-anxiety scenes containing embedded faces. In Experiment 2, to determine whether the presence of embedded faces, or anxiety level of scenes drove the reduced CR effect, we included contexts consisting of low-anxiety scenes with embedded faces. Once again, the CR effect was shown to be reduced, only when the context scene was highly anxiety-provoking with embedded faces; that is, reinstating the same, versus new, anxiety-provoking context failed to benefit target memory. Results suggest that the benefit of reinstating a context, on target memory, depends critically on the characteristics of the reinstated context."
From tea cakes to trauma: Bridging gaps between involuntary memory and mental health	Talk	2019a-CSBBCS	CSBBCS	6/8/19	"Waterloo, ON"		"We investigated the properties of recurrent IAMs in general populations, and assessed their relation to mental health. We found that recurrent IAMs were experienced by most of our sample (52%), and that these memories were mostly negative in valence. Those reporting a negative IAM as their most frequently recurring also reported significantly more mental health concerns (e.g., posttraumatic stress, social anxiety, depression). "	"Memories of one’s personal past that come to mind unintentionally and effortlessly are termed involuntary autobiographical memories (IAMs), and are reported to occur frequently in daily life within the general population (Berntsen, 1996; Rasmussen & Berntsen, 2011). In the current study, we investigate the properties of recurrent IAMs experienced in the general population, and assess their relation to mental health. Over two months, 2184 undergraduates responded to surveys querying the contents of their recurrent IAMs, as well as numerous qualitative aspects including their frequency and valence. Our findings show that recurrent IAMs are experienced by the majority of our sample (52%), and that these memories are mostly reported as being negative in valence. Additionally, those who report a negative IAM as their most frequently recurring one also report significantly more mental health concerns, including post-traumatic stress, social anxiety, and depression. We also found that the frequency at which an IAM recurs is predicted by the memory’s level of detail, emotional intensity, and its centrality to one’s life story. Finally, recurrent IAMs are described using significantly more words when they are emotionally positive, relative to negative or neutral. Recurrent IAMs may serve as a window into one’s mental health."
From tea cakes to trauma: Bridging gaps between involuntary memory and mental health	Talk	2019-TAMeG	TAMeG	5/14/19	"Toronto, ON"		Are recurrent memories common in the general population? Can recurrent memories predict symptoms of mental health disorders? Can we better characterize recurrent memories using their autobiographical properties?	
Altered working memory capacity for social threat words in high versus low social anxiety	Talk	2019-INS	INS	2/23/19	"New York, NY"		"Differences in working memory capacity may lead to preferential maintenance of socially threatening material in individuals with high social anxiety. Here we used word span tasks, adapted from the digit span task, to assess working memory capacity for material of varying threat-relatedness, in individuals with high or low social anxiety. Our findings suggest that individuals high in social anxiety may fail to upregulate working memory capacity for social information due to the activation of socially threatening concepts."	"Objective: Differences in working memory capacity have been suggested in individuals with high levels of social anxiety. Specifically, they may preferentially maintain socially threatening material in working memory. Here we used a series of word span tasks, adapted from the digit span task, to assess working memory capacity for material of varying threat-relatedness, in individuals either high or low in social anxiety.
Participants and Methods: In Experiment 1, 80 undergraduates were recruited (40 low social anxiety, 40 high social anxiety). Participants performed span tasks with words that were either neutral (e.g., ""errand""), generally threatening (e.g., ""abuse""), or socially threatening (e.g., ""party""). In Experiment 2, another 80 undergraduates were recruited (40 low social anxiety, 40 high social anxiety). Participants performed the same span tasks with the addition of a fourth word list that was both neutral and matched to the socially threatening word list in terms of semantic similarity.
Results: Experiment 1 revealed reduced working memory capacity for socially threatening words in those with high compared to low social anxiety. Importantly, this relative reduction in working memory capacity was driven by the low social anxiety group showing expanded capacity for socially threatening words relative to neutral or generally threatening words. Furthermore, reductions in working memory capacity for social threat were uniquely predicted by social anxiety, and not by other theoretically similar constructs such as state general anxiety, trait general anxiety, or depression. Experiment 2 showed that the semantic similarity of the words was not responsible for the differences in working memory capacity between list type or social anxiety group.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that individuals high in social anxiety may fail to upregulate working memory capacity for social information due to the activation of, or rumination upon, socially threatening concepts."
Bias in long-term and working memory in individuals with high versus low social anxiety	Talk*	2018-MDRS	MDRS	10/6/18	"Toronto, ON"		"Do individuals with high social anxiety show altered memory function for social materials? We asked if semantic meaning (i.e., social threat) drives subsequent memory. In two experiments, we find biases in long-term memory as well as working memory that are social threat-specific, which could not be explained by valence, arousal, or semantic similarity. "	
Social anxiety enhances recognition of task-irrelevant threat words	Talk	2018-TAMeG	TAMeG	5/15/18	"Toronto, ON"		"Are highly socially anxious people easily distracted in general, or is this bias specific to socially threatening material? In a simultaneous target-distractor paradigm, we investigated if memory for targets and distractors was affected by threat-relatedness. We found that emory bias is specific to threat-related distractors in high social anxiety. When social anxiety is primed, attention and memory may be specifically heightened for irrelevant, socially threatening information."
