collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ZazaYeung_2023
excerpt: "Over the last two decades, Canadian higher education has largely addressed students' mental health concerns through extra-curricular means. To instead embed education into the curriculum, CZ developed and taught an undergraduate course on mental health literacy. We conducted a pre-post study, finding that students made significant gains from T1 to T2, with a large effect size, in terms of attitudes toward seeking mental health services."

Over the last two decades, Canadian higher education has largely addressed students' mental health concerns through extra-curricular means. To instead embed education into the curriculum, CZ developed and taught an undergraduate course on mental health literacy. We conducted a pre-post study, finding that students made significant gains from T1 to T2, with a large effect size, in terms of attitudes toward seeking mental health services.
