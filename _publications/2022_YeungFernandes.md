title: "Machine learning to detect invalid text responses: Validation and comparison to existing detection methods"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/YeungFernandes_2022
excerpt: 'We propose and implement a supervised machine learning approach that can mimic the accuracy of human coding, but without the need to hand-code entire text datasets. Using autobiographical memory texts, we accurately detected invalid texts with performance near human coding, significantly outperforming existing data quality indicators.'

We propose and implement a supervised machine learning approach that can mimic the accuracy of human coding, but without the need to hand-code entire text datasets. Using autobiographical memory texts, we accurately detected invalid texts with performance near human coding, significantly outperforming existing data quality indicators.
