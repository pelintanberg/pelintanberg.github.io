excerpt: "We conducted three studies to evaluate the impacts of a fully online, for-credit mental health literacy (MHL) course. The pre-post study did not reveal any meaningful changes in knowledge and attitude from Time 1 to Time 2. In contrast, content analyses of the final reflection assignment showed multiple meaningful and positive shifts in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours related to mental health."
