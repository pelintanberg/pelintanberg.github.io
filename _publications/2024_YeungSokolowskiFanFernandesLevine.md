title: "The curse of imagery: Trait object and spatial imagery differentially relate to PTSD symptoms"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/YeungSokolowskiFanFernandesLevine_2024
excerpt: 'Imagery is integral to autobiographical memory (AM). Past work has highlighted the benefits of high trait imagery on episodic AM, including faster, more detailed, and more vivid retrieval. However, these advantages may come with drawbacks: following potentially traumatic events, strong visual imagery could promote the intrusions characteristic of PTSD. Conversely, spatial imagery could schematize potentially traumatic events, countering vivid recollection and reducing distress. In two independent samples, higher object imagery was associated with more PTSD symptoms. Higher spatial-schematic processing was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms.'

Imagery is integral to autobiographical memory (AM). Past work has highlighted the benefits of high trait imagery on episodic AM, including faster, more detailed, and more vivid retrieval.

Conversely, spatial imagery could schematize potentially traumatic events, countering vivid recollection and reducing distress. In two independent samples, higher object imagery was associated with more PTSD symptoms. Higher spatial-schematic processing was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms.
